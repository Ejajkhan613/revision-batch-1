7. Theory Day: Virtual DOM & How React Works
Cover reconciliation, component lifecycle (basic), and JSX vs HTML.


Reconciliation: It is a process of finding any update on the DOM and update it.
 React keeps a copy of DOM and whenever there is any changes it updates the DOM.
 The process is also known as "Diffing".
 It only updates the changed part of the real DOM


Component Lifecycle:
 It contains multiple phases of a component like creation, updation, deletion phases


JSX vs HTML:
 JSX is the syntax React uses to describe UI. It looks like HTML but works inside JavaScript.
 JSX is not HTML, but its converted to JavaScript by tools like Babel.
